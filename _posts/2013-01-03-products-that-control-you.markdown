<p>I seem to have gained a sudden interest in marketing products and I decided to really analyze why I buy products that I buy and then I realized that many other people do it for the very same reason.</p>
<p>In todays world, we see a lot of amazing products that just make us spend a lot of money. Yes, products with no emotion or senses making humans like us, capable of intelligent decision making, buy them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us are guilty of buying that one product that we fell in love with at first sight and then regretting ever even thinking of buying it. Few examples in my life: My laptop(not the mac), my phone, my head phones, my workout supplements, my body wash...the list could go on for a while and would tend to include simple products all of which I felt prey to consumer marketing.</p>
<p>So how do they do it?</p>
<p>1) They present you with the facts they want you to see and nothing more. If you were more informed or you knew exactly what you wanted, then this is pehaps a very easy one to beat. Example: I knew my computer wouldnt meet my needs so I decided to upgrade to a mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I cant really comment much for women(sorry), but for men, most companies tend to attract us to a product with the use of a super hot model (I am pretty sure many of us have fallen prey to the axe commercials)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Niche marketing strategies. Example: Workout supplements would tend to put a really jacked guy on the cover and use some of 1) in their promotions.</p>
<p>4) Generalized/Idealized lifestyle marketing strategies: I dont really know how to word this but what I mean is that a company will show you a product and show you an individual and put it like: "Hey you should be like this individual, this individual uses our product. You can be more like this individual by using our products!"</p>
<p>5) Celebrities! Had I not been restricted by my measely earnings I would have been draining my money into Adidas shoes by Derrick Rose. Would wearing those shoes make me as good? Hell No!!! Then why do I want it? I could write a long article on this, but to keep it simple, us humans tend to look at more successful people or just people who inspire us(in my case) and try to live a lifestyle as close to them as possible. Do I get paid millions of dollars? No. Can I afford an exotic sports car? Hell No (atleast not yet). Then I do I be as similar to D Rose as possible? Buy his shoes, jerseys, supplements...etc. Yeah I am too broke to fall for this and hopefully you all are too.</p>
<p>6) Directly attacking rivals. Not long ago there was a Rogers vs Bell campaign going on where they were basically trying to trump each other in commercials. I dont watch tv anymore, so I dont know if it still runs. I also know that briefly Wind mobile indirectly attacked these companies, although their marketing strategy in my honest opinion was amazing!</p>

<p>There are many more smart marketing strategies that I have not covered or merely not figured out yet. I hope to learn more as time progresses and hey maybe I could use some of these techniques to market my own products?</p>
