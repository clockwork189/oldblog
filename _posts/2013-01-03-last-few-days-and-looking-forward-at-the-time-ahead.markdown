<p>I havent written for a while and I do feel guilty. The last few weeks have been extremely busy and yet productive for me. I have learnt so much(new programming languages, graphic design, UI/UX building for user usability, hardward programming, etc). It is funny how much you can do once a burden has been lifted from you. I start school in 2 and a half months and believe it or not, I feel ready to go back in. I do fear what I shall face, but nonetheless, I am going back and doing it right. It is funny, my peers and family often tell me that I need to focus all my concentration on one thing and get really good at it. But I realized, that it is not possible to do so. The human mind is so complex, that it is almost impossible to program it to focus on one single thing. Your mind will wander. I have trained my mind to wander on things related to something I am working on so that even when I am not concentrating on said task, I am doing so on something related. Example: When I was learning about design, I tried reading books. I would go through a couple chapters and then my mind would start to wander towards learning Photoshop to improve my design skill and after a while, my mind wandered towards browsing design blogs and reading those and then I went back to reading and the cycle more or less stayed the same.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough lecture on how I concentrate. I hope to write a more meaningful post sometime soon!</p>
