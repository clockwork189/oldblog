<p>How do I get stronger? How do I get smarter? How do I become a better guitarist?&nbsp;How do I become better at *insert desirable skills here*? Well, the answer to all those questions is WORK F**KING HARD! No...not work hard. Not WORK HARD. But WORK F**KING HARD!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a radical extremist look at the world. No matter what skill in life you are good at, someone is always there trying to get better than you. You think you are the best basketball player? There is someone who trains from early morning before the sun rises to well after the sun sets. You think you are pretty strong? Guess what, someone is hitting the gym right now to getting stronger. I used to think training smart was enough. But it isnt. You gotta train hard and you gotta train smart. Dont expect to lose weight if you just go to the gym and not eat right or vice versa. Dont expect to ace, if you just read th material and not practice examples. You gotta put in the extra effort. You have to go the extra mile. That is the only way to get better at anything.</p>
<p>Be accountable and take charge of your life. If shit is falling apart around you, dont just crumble! Get up and pick things back up again.&nbsp;</p>
