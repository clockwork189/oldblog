<p>Ever wondered what it is like to feel indestructible? No pain, no fear. You could say that courage comes from feeling fear of doing something and then doing it anyways. If you fail enough with the intention to never back down, you become immune to any emotion that comes with failing. Does that mean that in order to feel strong, you have to fail a lot? No. It means that to feel strong you must not be afraid of taking risks. We only live once and experience is our greatest teacher. If we are unwilling to take risk and gain experience, then can we say we learn much? If I may add to that quote "Experience may be the greatest teacher, but failure is the greatest lesson you could learn". Accept that you can fail and that already puts you ahead of the game. Next all you have to do is work hard towards assuring you dont fail. That is a crucial mistake I made in my last term. I did not work hard enough to ensure that I didnt fail.</p>
<p>Here is a little competitive insight of me. I couldnt take failure, but at the same time, I couldnt back down from a challenge. In a way I still cant. If challenged, I would ensure I work the hardest towards winning, and even though I would not always win, I would comeback with important life lessons and work harder towards building that skill and becoming a winner. Even today, I know that every minute I rest, thereis someone out there, training harder than me to be better than me.</p>
