<p>Lately I have started this new routine of carrying around with a tiny sketch book, to write down any ideas that I may have. When I say any ideas, I do mean ANY and almost EVERY idea. Do not be surprised if you see a sketch of a possible tesla ray gun, iron man suit or even theories for wireless energy. Why collect these ideas? Why waste paper and sketch something that may never come to&nbsp;see the light of day? Well, why not?</p>
</p>
<p>I remember working back at Careerify, when I would approach my boss almost everyday with 1-10 ideas on improving the product. Most of the time I would get a "that wont survive in the market/thats not feasible/that is not sustainable, better luck next time!". However, atleast one of my ten ideas per day did make it into production and now I can say with pride that most of the cool features on the site were my idea. What if 1 in every 10 ideas that I have, is something that is plausible and can be executed? But how do I decide for what can be done and what cant?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have learned a lot more from those days and I feel like my brain pre-filters extremely bad ideas before they pop in my mind. Most of my ideas play around with stuff to do with user interfaces utilizing guestures and 3d interactions, or embedded systems and cool tricks you can do with an microcontrollers or even possible gaming/probability scenarios. Yeah, geek stuff that I am really into.</p>
<p>Writing down stuff allows me to break down the idea into a plan of approach, feasibility and costs. Sketching possible designs really helps for creation of visual elements of ideas, helping me develop a possible process for how it may work in the real world. It is also a nice, physical means of storage that I can peruse through when I am bored and need something to do. When I hold this tiny book, I feel like I am holding a source of a physical manifestation of genuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A long journey awaits but I already feel like I got my coop term cut out for side projects!</p>
