<p>Being a martial arts enthusiasts, I really approached exams, and life in general as a martial artist would in the past 2 weeks. I remember back when I was training in Kung Fu and when I did read various articles or even watch movies on the art of the Shaolin, a common line is: "Kung Fu is a way of life, it is not just a way to fight or move. It is how you manage yourself daily". I feel like after truly applying myself in my last exam I know what that means.</p>
<p>Have you ever felt yourself as being inadequate/untrained/unable to be the best? Ever felt that feeling or striving for the best, but just ending up failing and hoping to not be the worst in the end? It is a pretty sharp feeling. One that really cuts right through you, exposing your weaknesses. I felt just like that after I wrote an exam that I thought I did bad in. I felt weak, sad and broken...like there is no use plowing forward. Worst part was, I knew what I did bad on...without checking the solutions. I was just unprepared. Like Sun Tzu said "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles". Do I really know what I am capable of? In my journey of perfection, have I garnered enough faults that I have now become an exact opposite of what I strive to be? Or is it that what makes me strong is also my greatest weakness?&nbsp;Some times I think of what I am really capable of. Really dropping out of school could be the fastest way to bring it out. But that would also mean giving up everything that I love...Dragon Boat...CUTC...friends. It would be a true Shaolin/Ninjutsu choice, "Life with no attachements".</p>
<p>This quote from Kill Bill really gets to me sometimes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 18px;">Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker. When that character wakes up in the morning, he's Peter Parker. He has to put on a costume to become Spider-Man. And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone. Superman didn't become Superman. Superman was born Superman. When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red "S", that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes. What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent. He's weak... he's unsure of himself... he's a coward. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I really Superman, disguised as Clark to blend in better with the world? Is "Birdman" really a critique on what a students life should be? Or am I just Peter Parker...waiting to be bitten by what may be a super spider that would help me unlock my full potential? Nevertheless, I am still young but wiser. I will sharpen my blade before I walk into battle. I leave you with the following quote(again by Sun Tzu):</p>
<p><a name="strategic assessments" style="color: #2f4f4f; font-family: ARIAL; font-size: small; background-color: #f8f8ff;">
<li style="display: inline !important;">
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Use humility to make them haughty. Tire them by flight. Cause division among them. Attack when they are unprepared, make your move when they do not expect it.</blockquote>
<a name="strategic assessments">
<li style="display: inline !important;">I am done putting on my armour...</li>
</a>I am done sharpening my blade...I am done running...I am done backing down. I am done...not being perfect...just done. I need to be better...I need to be the best. But for now in the shadows I hide...blind folded, yet guided by the sound of the whispers of enemy sword sheaths.</li>
</a></p>
