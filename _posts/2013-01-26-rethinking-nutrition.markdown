<p>I have been hitting the gym hard and regularly, I have even been putting
some extra workouts in, yet I am still struggling with losing some
leftover mass from my youth. Yep, I was a chubby kid when I was young.
The kind that stuffed himself with as much KFC, McDonalds, Hardees,
Burger King, Pizza Hut pizzas...damn now that I think about it, I lived
like a king of fast food back then. Coming from a village child life,
these cheap yet filling delicacies had enraptured my taste buds to the
extent that I probably gluttoned down these foods without even thinking
about it.</p> 

<p>There came a time though, when I thought "I want to be lean
and jacked!". I took my first gym membership when I was 12. Yup I was the
youngest member they had...it was scary back then, being surrounded by
what seemed to be giants with anvils for arms. I have been
working out since then, but I didnt really do any specific type of
programming. I was more of the bicep kinda guy and spent ages at the
curl rack. </p> 

<p>Eventually I came to Canada, got acquainted with the Canadian system
of education and LO-BEHOLD!!!! My school had a gym! Yep, I found my new
haven! Again, I continued sculpting my arms to no limit. Lets fast
forward to when I get to University. Hey, now I have a choice of 2
GYMS!!! It is like a dream! Again, go to the gym and start curling some
dumbells. I did do my fair bit of cardio, so I did get a few pounds
lighter, but I wanted to get leaner! I wanted to grate cheese on my
abdominals! It was in my second year when I decided, "Alright, I am
gonna lose all this fat and get a six pack...in 60 FREAKING
DAYS!"...might I add with no artificial supplements.</p>

<p>I researched nutrition, kept a strict diet(hell my friends busted me
eating Burger King twice...Thanks guys..and there after I kept to it). I worked hard at the gym, <a href="http://cdesouza-birdman.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">documented my workouts</a> and  actually lost 30lbs(from 185lb to 153lb). I was in the best shape of my life and I had a kinda nice setof abs to show for it. But what happened after those 60 days. I held on for a while, but then I craved for all the foods I missed out on. Oh that Twice the deal Pizza(2 xl pizzas), Burger King, KFC...well what not. I had sported a pretty high metabolic rate so I didnt really gain any weight...but my kinda nice set of abs...vanished.</p>

<p>That was about one and a half year ago. Since then I have been a bit
more stricter about what I put into my body...but I think being strict
doesnt cut it. Nutrition shouldnt be an imposition...it should be a way
of life. I doubt that anyone goes "Hey guys! Lets go out and get
hammered because today is my cheat day!" or "Goddamit, I am gonna pass
on that pizza because I am on a diet...even though I love pizza :(". I
dont want to be that guy. If I were to follow a meal plan, it has to be
something I can live with everyday and bear no regrets. Hell, if I was
offered a slice of Pizza today and said no and I happen to die
tomorrow...I would be really pissed! I aint dying without that slice!
But in all seriousness, I have gotten strong, I have gotten good cardio,
but I still have those last few inches of fat in my body. I have been
researching nutrition in the past few days and I think I figured a meal
plan that would work best for me.</p>

<h4>Breakfast(pre workout1) 6:00am-7:00am</h4>
<ul>
	<li>2 Fried Eggs with 3 slices of Bacon</li>
	<li>1 pancake and 1 Waffle</li>
	<li>Coffee</li>
</ul>
<h4>Breakfast(post workout1) 9:00-10:00am</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Oat meal with honey and blueberries</li>
	<li>Half a grape fruit</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lunch 1  12:00pm-1:00pm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>2 Turkey/Beef/Chicken sandwiches with Tomatoes, olive and hot
sauce</li>
	<li>1 Litre of Water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lunch 2(pre workout2)  4:00pm-5:00pm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>2 Turkey/Beef/Chicken sandwiches with Tomatoes, olive and
hot sauce	
	<li>1 Litre of Water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dinner(post workout2) 7:30-8:30pm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Chicken/Beef/shrimp stir fry</li>
	<li>(Optional) Salmon</li>
	<li>(Or) Beef Chilli</li>
	<li>1 Litre of Water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Optional Late night snack(or post workout2 for some days) 10:00-11:00pm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>2 Tuna/Chicken/Beef sandwiches</li>
	<li>1 Litre of Water</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It is pretty straight forward and basic. These are foods that I eat
regularly nonetheless, just at weirder times and in disproportionate
quantities. I personally hate vegetables...which is why I love stir
fry's! The meat almost wipes out the taste of vegetables. This kinda
differs from my plan from 2 years ago in the sense that the meals dont
really get smaller as the day goes by. Also keep in mind...this is for
me. I aint writing nutrition for anyone but myself as I know my body
best. That is why you see 1 L of water specified so frequently. I love
water, in a day I drown atleast 6L's with ease.

<p>
I guess I shall try this for a month and see how it goes. I cant rely on
weighing scales to measure results due to the fact that I may gain
muscle, instead i shall rely on the body fat % measure utilizing
callipers.
