<p>Its been a long time agreed. I have been busy with helping out CUTC, work and of course building my windows phone apps. This post will be a little look back at where I was and where I am heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>January 2012: Learnt of not making it to my next term. Most shocking news I ever heard and hardest news I broke to my parents who actually sympathized with me.</p>
<p>February 2012: Out of depression and precaution for the future, abandoned my startup endeavours. Instead decided to seek mentorship from my current boss and learn more about bootstrapping and growing.</p>
<p>March 2012: Officially got cut from UWDBC HK team, something I trained 8 months for and in some cases gave it more priority than school. Big mistake either way. Now looking back, I am glad. It was a well deserved ego shattering experience.</p>
<p>April 2012: Looked at CUTC as the last loose string I needed to cut myself from. Totally forgot what I stood for. Luckily it lasted only temporarily and I learnt the hidden potential within me.</p>
<p>May 2012: Present. CUTC is done. However, I grew so fond of the team that I am definitely going back next term. Am I setting myself up for failure? No. I will drop UWDBC if need be. CUTC was like a family to me. The people were amazing, the organization is amazing and I am looking forward to taking over a bigger role next term. All I can say is that I made it my personal goal to make CUTC the most recognized name in terms of tech conferences in Canada and maybe even the world.</p>
<p>What lies ahead?</p>
<p>Hardware Hacking and Arduinos: This has become my new passion and I must say, this is pretty fun.</p>
<p>Becoming a better person: Screw being a badass. I would rather be respected than well liked or feared. I want to do more good, inspire and help more people. This is one of the main reason I am sticking with CUTC.</p>
<p>Facebook: Yes, I have made it my personal goal to get a facebook interview next term. I will do everything now. If you know me well, then you know I am best at hustling. I will land a fb interview if not a job next term.</p>
<p>Meditation: Some people do yoga, some tai chi, I do martial arts.</p>
<p>Becoming a better student: I have studied a shit load of stuff you wouldnt imagine. All thanks to coursera.org. Going back this fall, I got my eyes on the prize. Rank 1. I need to reclaim the last title my friends left me with, GOAT. Although, I do hope to help anyone who needs help. Please, I dont like competition.</p>
