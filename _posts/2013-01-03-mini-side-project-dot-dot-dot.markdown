As of late, I have either been working out really hard on work stuff or really hard on CUTC stuff or just working out.  I have not taken on a side project in 2 months and I just realized precisely what I want to do. See I am an avid workout junky and I like tracking my workout results. As of lately I have been seeing no gains, even though I still workout, however I have had gains in terms of muscle size. Then I thought to myself, there must be a better way to keep track of gains, rather than just through pen and paper or excel spreadsheets and thats when it it me! This is what my new side project will be. I am tempted to set upon writing it in php, however I have had my eyes set on RoR for a while and I think I will learn it through this project! Still havent come up with a name for it yet...TrackMyProgress.me? ProgressCounter.me? Man I am really bad with names, but lets see how this goes.
