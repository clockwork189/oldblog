I attended the National Business and Technology Conference this weekend hosted by Nspire and had a really good time. I got to meet and network with some amazing people and the speakers were very inspiring. While I enjoyed all the speakers, I think the one I learnt the most from is Allan Lau's. He basically spoke about his mistakes and provided the following checklist for entrepreneurship. Even though it may not be absolute, it does give everybody a good idea of what is required.
<br/>
<ul>
    <li><u>Validate the idea</u>: Examine the opportunity, competition and its ability to grow and make an impact.</li>
    <li><u>Never go solo</u>: It is better to own 50% of something than 100% nothing. Having a partnership helps you divide the work between yourself another person. However, do ensure you have an agreement.</li>
    <li><u>Examine Capital</u>: Before you start working on your idea, ask yourself: "Do I need money?". 9 times out of 10 is that you dont and you eventually end up exhausting your resources trying to obtain venture capital.</li>
    <li><u>Where is the plan</u>? A business plan is like a map of execution. However all your resources and energy must not be exhausted on one, but it is still important to have. A website or app is not enough. You must have atleast a brief plan before you execute.</li>
 </ul>
