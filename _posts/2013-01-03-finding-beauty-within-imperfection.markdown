<p>Wabi Sabi is a commonly used Japanese principle where one finds beauty within imperfections of design. As humans, we are the an ultimate example of Wabi Sabi. We are a species that can never truly reach perfection yet we constantly strive to achieve it like a dog chasing its own tail. I like the following quote by Dalai Lama when he was asked what surprised him the most about humanity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">&ldquo;Man.</span><br style="color: #666666; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" /><span style="color: #000000; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money.</span><br style="color: #666666; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" /><span style="color: #000000; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health.</span><br style="color: #666666; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" /><span style="color: #000000; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present;</span><br style="color: #666666; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" /><span style="color: #000000; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">the result being that he does not live in the present or the future;</span><br style="color: #666666; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" /><span style="color: #000000; font-family: times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To truly live, would mean to experience life to its fullest, to break all boundaries, cross all limitations. To truly live, would mean to feel fear, to absorb it and face the experience nevertheless. To truly live, would mean to face each day like it is a present.&nbsp;</p>
