A few years ago, before I started university, I had built my first real program. It was a ping pong game in Java. A few months later I wrote a "Breakout" game with a group of friends. I dont know how to describe it, but I felt some sort of intuitiveness everytime I wrote a program. It was as if I knew exactly how the computer thought and how to communicate with it.
