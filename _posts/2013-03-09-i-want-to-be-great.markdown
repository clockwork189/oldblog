I went to the NBTC'13 conference yesterday and I had several eye opening moments. The big ones were:
1) Business students seem to be into entrepreneurship for the money or to not work for someonelse, yet try to cover it up with sorry excuses like "I want to change the world.
Honestly, not being satisfied working for someone else is the most stupid reason I have heard for people turning to entrepreneurship. Really? You dont want a boss? Or are you just a bad social person? Think about it, in entrepreneurship you are constantly working for someone. More so, you work for more people. You raise capital...you are working for the VC to get his money back. Once you get big enough, you are working to satisfy your board of directors. If you hire employees, you are working FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES to ensure that they are happy. The last one is the one mistake that separates the good entrepreneurs from the great ones. It is also the reason why most people want to be entrepreneurs. Mark Zuckerberg, he works for the facebook board of directors and for his share holders. Late Steve Jobs, the same. Steve Balmer, THE FUCKING SAME! So really, when you become an entrepreneur, shit gets tough. You may think you are working for no one, but in truth you are working for more people than you would as a regular employee.

2) Hackers, love building things. They love coding, love breaking stuff and overall love creating. So much so that they think that any stupid little thing they create makes for a good product.
I fall under this group. I will be honest though, I love this group. The amount of passion that these people speak with, make them the most interesting conversationist...at least for me. They can go on for hours about things they built and about why they believe it will succeed in the real world and why I must use their product. Honestly...they need the people from the first group(business people), to help them out with actually marketing their product.

3) The world is changing so fast, that it is almost impossible to keep up with the changes.
There is always this big talk about "The next big thing!". From guesture based interactions, to FOLED touch screens to even smart watches...hell I am surprised they havent come out with instant bacon yet. But really, the world is changing...and I want to be a bigger part of the change.
