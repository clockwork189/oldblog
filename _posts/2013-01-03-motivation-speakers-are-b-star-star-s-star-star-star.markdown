<p><span style="font-style: inherit;">Last weekend,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;">I hit up the mushiest conference I have ever been to. I feel like almost hugging a hobo and crying in his shoulders and then proceeding to build a home for homeless animals and end my day meditating on a mountain in the himalayas.The conference was all about social entrepreneurship, however there was a big focus on motivation.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: none; color: #595959; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;">I noticed a trend that I cant believe I never noticed before. 1) A lot of people are unsatisfied with their jobs and think about quitting and becoming "entrepreneurs" and 2) Motivation Speakers are B***s***. I'll discuss the former sometime later, but for now I'll focus on the latter.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: none; color: #595959; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;">Do you really need motivation to do something? Is motivation even a thing? I remember times when I tried to lose a lot of weight and get jacked, or times when I really wanted to make my dragon boat team, or times when I wanted to run long distances. I would push myself really hard and not let my brain get the most of me. I was and still am, driven by my passion for excellence. I wanted whatever I was pursuing so badly and to do it to the best of my abilities, that I didnt need any form of external motivation. There were times when I was down in the gutters like: after failing my term and repeating a year, or after failing at my first two startup ventures, or even after getting no appreciation at work regardless of how hard or long I worked. I found it within myself to crawl out of whatever trench I was in and make it through.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: none; color: #595959; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;">Motivation is what drives you to wake up the next morning to attack the day head on. It is what keeps you getting up everytime you fall. Stop being weak!</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;You dont need some cooke speaking with a lot of hoopla in his voice to get motivated!</span></p>
