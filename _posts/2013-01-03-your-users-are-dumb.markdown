<p>Yes, I said it and I'll say it once more: Your users are dumb. They have no idea what they are doing. This technolgy they are interacting with is way beyond their comprehension. Those elderly people think they broke the system, but it really is the developers fault who forgot to factor in that test case. Your user accidentally pressed delete and is now like "Oh no, I cant undo this!". You tell him "Oh you shouldnt have done that, now it is all your fault", but deep down inside you know that you as a developer, quality analyst, product tester, or whatever your role be with relation to the product, have missed that one error and now you make poor Timothy, your loyal customer, feel bad he did some thing wrong.</p>
<p>We all should be ashamed of ourselves. There is no such thing as a perfect product, just a better product and as a developer who is guilty of creating bad products, I cant stress enough how much thought needs to go into designing a system.</p>
<p>A good product is something so intuitive that users are not afraid of breaking it, meanwhile it can be seamlessly extended and the experience for the users is super easy. Here is my thought on that, the easier a product has to be for the user, the more work as developers/product designers we need to put into creating it. Its hard, tiring and sometimes you just feel like you are running into a wall. But you know what is better than a million users? A billion users! A billion happy users!</p>
