<p>I guess the first expectation from a student who failed his last term would be to go back and hit the books 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To be honest, I learnt that that is exactly not the way to live. We are only in university for 5 years, (well me 6 but you get the point). You have to live a little. Have fun, party, go crazy! Because to be honest, after graduation, especially if you are coming from a technical program like engineering, its all work no play for you. Yeah sure you will be going bowling once a week, probably hit the bar every thursday, but you can forget about those wild university/college parties.</p>
<p>You are going to hate me for saying this, but here it goes anyways. In university, we have the right to be stupid and do crazy things. Of course, there are stuff of moral and civil boundaries that we cannot cross. But that doesnt mean you lock yourself in your room or library and study. Go out, have fun, make friends and learn a shit load of new things because work life doesnt leave room for any of that unfortunately.</p>
