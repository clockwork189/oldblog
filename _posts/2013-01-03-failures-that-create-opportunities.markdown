The biggest and most important thing I recently learnt from failing my last study term is that failue is never the end of the world. In fact is just marks the point of a new beginning. I am not academically gifted. I have worked extremely hard to get to where I am now. I had a great coop job in a great company, and nothing could be better. Except, I was not happy. I fell into a boring routine, where everyday would feel the same and it came to a point where I tried going about my day differently to avoid being routinely, but as you can expect, it never worked. 9 to 5s arent from me.I am right now taking a break from my work (which I am doing from home) to write this. I could never be happier. I dont think I have worked a second in my current job because I like what I am doing that much. I am not only surrounded by the right mentors and environment, but I create stuff that I know millions of other people will use and nothing could make me feel better.

I am now taking the opportunity of using the extra time that I have to first build my coding skills and then learn as much about entrepreneurship as possible. I am taking advantage of this opportunity that was created through failure and I can feel like this is the start of something big.
