When I was first approached with the idea of being a technical co founder, just the very thought of being a boss exhilerated me. It felt like "Wow, I am in total control of everything to do with this technology, sweet". However, what I didnt see were the possible implications of going into a highly competitive market space with little capital and experience(running a company) against companies who literally spend millions on stuff like this. I am not going to go into details, but lets just say our biggest competitor would have been Monster.ca
<br/><br/>
Now I am not gonna pretend, when I accepted this role, little did I expect that it would take me that much longer and how big of underdogs we really were. Me, a web developer, with barely enough skill to get into a top notch software company, and my co-founder, an undergrad in Arts. We did not have enough mentorship(sure there were a couple of profs, but no real field experts, no real entrepreneurs, no one who had experience launching our company).
<h3>What went wrong?</h3>
From my end personally the ETA. I was supposed to have the system ready in 6 months, but it really took me 8 to get it to a point it was presentable. Once that was done, the other guy was supposed to promote it. But...that did not happen. Understandably, the other guy got caught up in a lot of academic stuff (I put this over academics, I dont know if it was a good or bad idea, but I did fail a term, so it was probably a bad idea). We ran low on the mullah, we did not have any good marketers on our team and it was a product anybody could replicate (i.e. no patents).
<h3>How I tried to save it?</h3>
I jumped into marketing and took over. I went the extra mile and contacted employers, put my ass out there and tried to get clients. But like I said, I had no mentorship, no experience and no knowledge of the field. Hence I failed.
<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
Hm, lots but lets simplify this part into simple points:
<ul>
    <li>Dont jump into something you have no knowledge about, i.e. before you launch something know your market.</li>
    <li>Know your competitors, fear them and think about how to one up on them. It isnt about doing something different all the time, its is also about doing something better.</li>
    <li>Know your cofounders and their commitments. In this case, I could have probably seen this coming but did not think that my success would rely on another person.</li>
    <li>Drop the ego. I once worked in a company where I was constantly looked down upon(coincidentally this was during the same time I was building this solution and I thought to myself, if I ever have a company, I will treat all my employees equally). Even though we did not have any employees, all I could ever think about is how much fun it would be to be the boss. Just drop that mentality...</li>
    <li>Money isnt everything, but it is still something. If you are smart, of course you can launch a company with zero dollars...wait no you cant. You can build a product for that price, but not launch a company. Why? Do you know how much lawyers cost? How much it costs to incorporate? Buy a domain? hosting service? equipment? Trust me over a month, those things add up. You will be in the negative for  a while before you climb. Your goal should be to keep that negative as close to zero as possible (if you have acquaintances who can help you keep it to zero (father is a lawyer, mom owns a amazon or whatever, then good for you and be sure to introduce me to them).</li>
    <li>Focus on your domain, but keep an eye on others. If you are a marketer, ensure you excel at getting clients, but keep an eye out and ensure your developers are coding a quality application. If you are a developer, ensure you build the best app possible (this is your baby goddamit!) but ensure your marketer is doing a good job of promoting your products.</li> 
    <li>You cant sell something no one knows about.</li>
    <li>You cant sell something you do not know if people would use. This advice was given to me by my current boss who I consider a true entrepreneur, marketer and a mentor. Actually cold call your potential clients(there are ways to make cold calls more personal, read books like "Never Eat Alone" by Keith Ferrazzi and "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie to learn more). Ask them if they would use your product. Better yet, develop a relationship with them early on and build it to a more personal level. It is easier to talk to a friend then a stranger.</li>
    <li>Choose your cofounders wisely. Although I didnt be the one to choose (I accepted), if I were to go back, I would first get to know my cofounder, learn how we could work together without stepping on each others domain but at the same time keeping each other informed. This is a key thing to making companies work and a big reason why many fail.</li>
</ul>

Lastly, your foresight will tell you to build a startup, your goal should be to build a company. Think big, think for the future.
