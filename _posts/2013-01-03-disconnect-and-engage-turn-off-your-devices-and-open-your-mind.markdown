<p>After a long days worth of work, I catch the GO Train to head back home. I sit in my usual spot near the window as I enjoy observing the scenic views the train passes as it takes me to my destination. No matter how many times I grab the train or sit in the same seat, these views seem so surreal, so beautiful, so absorbing, so malevolent, so *RING RING*.</p>
<p>That was my train of thought getting interupted by the person sitting beside me. Middle aged woman, answering her call from her daughter regarding preparing dinner, hanging out with her friends and heading out to her friends for the weekend. I dont want to sound like I was listening in on the conversation, but there isnt much one can do, when someone right beside them talks with such a high voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look up and see everyone on the train is either on their blackberry texting (or BBM-ing), iphones/ipods listening to music and of course the people getting extra work on their laptops. Hey I am guilty of doing so myself, in fact more often then I would like to admit. But we have come to a point where we are starting to disconnect from in person interactions to more cyber interactions. I as a strong web enthusiast, am afraid that technology might soon be the end to personal relationships.</p>
<p>I am extremely socially awkward on internet chats. I mean, I rely on recognizing human emotions and using those to help let me know if a conversation is going uphill or otherwise. On the cyberspace I feel like I am in question the entire time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I think the world needs is a much better yet non intrusive means of communication. If I had the answer to that, I would obviously be hard at work on it.</p>
<p>But for now, Mrs Lady beside me, please talk softer and yes, daughter will be fine with the leftovers from the other night and assuming you trust her enough to leave her alone with your younger son, I guess she can feed him. Now can I get back to nature?</p>
