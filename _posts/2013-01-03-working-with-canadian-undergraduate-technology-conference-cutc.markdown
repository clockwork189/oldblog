<p>Last year I joined an amazing team to put together a technology conference aimed at undergraduate tech enthusiasts called CUTC or Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference for those of you who hate accronyms. I was mainly involved with the Web Development portion of the conference and at times I did some social media marketing or just general campaigning for the event. On the conference day, I helped everywhere from registration to chapperoning general events. The whole experience was pretty surreal. The conference felt important from the first day I started working but I felt the true magnitude on the day of, when hundreds of like minded students filled the room. It felt like one of those moments where you look out and see something you helped build, come to life and start walking right in front of you. I was impressed at what we, a bunch of university/college/highschool students, put together and that motivated me to apply to a bigger and more involved roled this year.</p>
<p>The bar is raised and the stakes are high, which means this years conference should surpass all expectations. We are striking bringing to light the tech center of Canada and this year, we shall do it like never before! Bigger...better...and more...infectious...</p>
