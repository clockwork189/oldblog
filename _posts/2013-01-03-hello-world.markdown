It has become almost instinctive of me to write a "Hello World" program when testing out a new application, platform or even something as simple as a blog post. I am a programmer by trade, but an aspiring entrepreneur. Oh, I also go to University of Waterloo, love working out, gaming (PS3 ftw) and I easily get hooked on any TV series.
