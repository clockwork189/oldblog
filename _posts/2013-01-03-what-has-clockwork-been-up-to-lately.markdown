<p>I have been trying to get into mobile web development. This is basically building HTML5 apps and passing them through "binary converters" and getting local binaries for iphone, android, bb and windows phone. My current app, since I am just dipping my toes in the water, is an app that allows you to find out what time you should sleep to get your body fully vitalized. It is a basic app that you put in what time you want to sleep and it will calculate the number of REM cycles for a good sleep and give you what time to wake up. Nothing too big or too complex. I know I had a big need for this back in university. I have finished building it, I just need to get it out to the app stores :)</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>
