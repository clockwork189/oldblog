A few months ago, I had gone to a conference that attracted entrepreneurs from various parts of Ontario and from various levels in the whole startup cycle. I walked up to a particularly interesting one, a startup that dealt with finding lyrics for songs that claimed that they just raised a round of investment. I found it intriguing that they were so successful despite their domain being so clouded by competitors so I asked one of them what was their secret. The group of three entrepreneurs(CEO, CTO and COO I am guessing), burst out laughing and say: "Luck!". Luck? Really? Is that what the startup community has come to? They explain luck to find investors, luck to find users, luck to market, luck to find developers. I just thought WOW and walked away. A couple of months later I hear that their investor backed out and the company shuts down...

I have a philosophy that luck is just a figment of your imagination. It is a result of your mind attributing an event that it might not deem possible to external factors, factors that are not in your full control. By completely eliminating the aspect of luck from your life, you see things through a whole new perspective. A perspective that has you take full control of your life. It is a perspective, where the only person to blame for your failures is you and the only person to attribute your success to is that pretty face you see in the mirror.</p>

Why dont I like luck? It keeps you hungry. It keeps you hoping. It keeps the near future to you unpredictable. You cant calculate an uncertainty that you are not in control of. It also makes you weak. You willingly give up a little control of your life to some undefined contant, just hoping, that it turns in your favor. There is this saying, "There is a higher probability of you dying on the way to buy a lottery, than you actually winning it." Then why do people play it? I am pretty sure that there are more losers in the history of lotteries than winners. So why bother? I think people do it for the adrenaline. To experience a would be feeling that so few people do.
